Extinction coefficients:
Extinction coefficients are in units of  M-1 cm-1, at 280 nm measured in water.
Ext. coefficient    42525
Abs 0.1% (=1 g/l)   3.017, assuming all pairs of Cys residues form cystines



Ext. coefficient    42400
Abs 0.1% (=1 g/l)   3.008, assuming all Cys residues are reduced

Estimated half-life:
The N-terminal of the sequence considered is E (Glu).
The estimated half-life is: 1 hours (mammalian reticulocytes, in vitro).
                            30 min (yeast, in vivo).
                            >10 hours (Escherichia coli, in vivo).

Instability index:
The instability index (II) is computed to be 27.52
This classifies the protein as stable.

Aliphatic index: 52.74
Grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY):-0.570
