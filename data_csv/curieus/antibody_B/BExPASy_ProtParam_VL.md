Extinction coefficients:
Extinction coefficients are in units of  M-1 cm-1, at 280 nm measured in water.
Ext. coefficient    18575
Abs 0.1% (=1 g/l)   1.594, assuming all pairs of Cys residues form cystines



Ext. coefficient    18450
Abs 0.1% (=1 g/l)   1.583, assuming all Cys residues are reduced

Estimated half-life:
The N-terminal of the sequence considered is L (Leu).
The estimated half-life is: 5.5 hours (mammalian reticulocytes, in vitro).
                            3 min (yeast, in vivo).
                            2 min (Escherichia coli, in vivo).

Instability index:
The instability index (II) is computed to be 52.35
This classifies the protein as unstable.

Aliphatic index: 126.39
Grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY):0.578
